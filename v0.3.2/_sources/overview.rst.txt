Overview
========

Given two tables A and B, this package provides commands to perform string similarity joins between two columns of these tables, such as A.name and B.name, or A.city and B.city. An example of such joins is to return all pairs (x,y) of tuples from the Cartesian product of Tables A and B such that 

* x is a tuple in Table A and y is a tuple in Table B.
* Jaccard(3gram(x.name), 3gram(y.name)) > 0.7. That is, first tokenize the value of the attribute "name" of x into a set P of 3grams, and tokenize the value of the attribute "name" of y into a set Q of 3grams. Then compute the Jaccard score between P and Q. This score must exceed 0.7. This is often called the "join condition". 

Such joins are challenging because a naive implementation would consider all tuple pairs in the Cartesian product of Tables A and B, an often enormous number (for example, 10 billion pairs if each table has 100K tuples). The package provides efficient implementations of such joins, by using methods called "filtering" to quickly eliminate the pairs that obviously cannot satisfy the join condition. 

To understand tokenizing and string similarity scores (such as Jaccard, edit distance, etc.), see the `Web site <https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/projects/py_stringmatching>`_ of the package py_stringmatching (in particular, read the following `book chapter on string matching <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/py_stringmatching/dibook-string-matching.pdf>`_). That package provides efficient implementations of a set of tokenizers and string similarity measures. It focuses on the case of tokenizing two strings and then applying a similarity measure to the outputs of the tokenizers to compute a similarity score between those two strings. This package builds on top of py_stringmatching, so it is important to understand the tokenizers and string similarity measures of the py_stringmatching package. 

To read more about string similarity joins, see "`String Similarity Joins: An Experimental Evaluation <http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p625-jiang.pdf>`_" and "`String Similarity Search and Join : A Survey <http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/papers/fcs15-string-survey.pdf>`_".

We now explain the most important notions an user is likely to encounter while using this package. To use the package, the user typically loads into Python two tables A and B (as described above). These two tables will often be referred to in the commands of this package as ltable (for "left table") and rtable (for "right table"), respectively. The notion "tuple pair" refers to a pair (x,y) where x is a tuple in ltable and y is a tuple in rtable. 

To execute a string similarity join, the user calls a command such as jaccard_join, cosine_join, etc. The command's arguments include

* The two tables: ltable and rtable, the key attributes of these tables, and the target attributes (on which the join will be performed, such as A.name and B.name).
* The join condition.
* The output will be a table of tuple pairs surviving the join. The user may want to specify the desired attributes of the output table, using arguments such as l_out_attrs, r_out_attrs, l_out_prefix, etc.
* A flag to indicate on how many cores should this command be run. 

Internally, a command such as jaccard_join will first create a filter object, using an appropriate filtering techniques (many such techniques exist, see the `book chapter on string matching <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/py_stringmatching/dibook-string-matching.pdf>`_). Next, it uses this filter object to quickly drop many pairs that obviously do not satisfy the join condition. The set of remaining tuple pairs is referred to as a "candidate set". Finally, it applies a matcher to the pairs in this set. The matcher simply checks and retains only those pairs that satisfy the join condition. 

The implemented commands can be organized into the following groups: profilers, joins, filters, matchers, and utilities. We now briefly describe these. 

Profilers
---------

After loading the two tables A and B into Python, the user may want to run a profiler command, which will examine the two tables, detect possible problems for the subsequent string similarity joins, warn the user of these potential problems, and suggest possible solutions. 

Currently only one profiler has been implemented, profile_table_for_join. This command examines the tables for unique and missing attribute values, and discuss possible problems stemming from these for the subsequent joins. Based on the report of this command, the user may want to take certain actions before actually applying join commands. Using the profiler is not required, of course. 

Joins
-----

After loading and optionally profiling and fixing the tables, most likely the user will just call a join command to do the join. We have implemented the following join commands:  

* cosine_join
* dice_join
* edit_distance_join
* jaccard_join
* overlap_coefficient_join
* overlap_join

All the above commands expect the input tables, intermediate results, and the output tables to fit in memory.  However, if the intermediate results or the output tables are large, these commands will produce a memory error. To address this, we have started to implement disk-based version of above commands. As a first step, we have implemented the following command.


* disk_edit_distance_join

The above command implements disk-based version of edit distance join. Specifically, this command will spill the intermediate results and the output tables to disk when they get too large to fit in memory. Currently, this command is experimental and not tested thoroughly.

Filters & Matchers
------------------

Most users will just use join commands (described above). They do not need to know about filters and matchers. However, users who want to perform more complex string similarity joins (or joins that we currently do not yet support) may find filters and matchers useful and may want to use them. (See the How-to Guide for examples of performing complex string similarity joins such as TF/IDF joins.)

Filters are class objects. They form the following class hierarchy: 

Filter                                                            
  * OverlapFilter
  * SizeFilter
  * PrefixFilter
  * PositionFilter
  * SuffixFilter

Currently we have implemented only one matcher, called "apply_matcher".

Utilities
---------

Consider a table A with an attribute "year". This attribute contains numeric, not string, values. So we cannot apply the commands in py_stringsimjoin on this attribute directly (as these commands input only string values). To apply the command, we first must convert the values of this attribute (for example, 1978, 2001, etc.) into strings. This conversion is somewhat tricky, because if we are not careful, missing values such as NaN will be converted into strings "NaN". 
In this package we have provided several utility commands to do such conversion.
