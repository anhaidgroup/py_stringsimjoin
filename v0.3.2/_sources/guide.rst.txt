Guides
======

To learn to quickly use the package, you can check out

* a `quickstart guide for Jaccard join 
  <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anhaidgroup/py_stringsimjoin/blob/master/notebooks/Joining%20two%20tables%20using%20Jaccard%20measure.ipynb>`_.

* a `quickstart guide for edit distance join 
  <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anhaidgroup/py_stringsimjoin/blob/master/notebooks/Joining%20two%20tables%20using%20edit%20distance%20measure.ipynb>`_
  (which is very similar to the case of Jaccard join, but the input strings are not tokenized). 

The `package homepage <https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/projects/py_stringsimjoin>`_ provides 
a link to the How-To Guide, which provides a complete set of instructions for using 
this package (including performing more complex joins such as TF/IDF).
